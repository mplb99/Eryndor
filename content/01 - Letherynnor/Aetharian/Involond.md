## Overview
A town in [[Aetharian]], for smaller up and coming wizards. A town full of experimental magic, most of the people in this town are aiming to make it out of the town and to [[Laraenthas]], where the greatest magical schools and wizards are. The wizards of Involond are expected to govern themselves without much formal intervention. There is technically an overseer of the town, currently an Eladrin named Olaster, but this is more a ceremonial position, with the person elected each year and basically becoming a proxy of [[Laraenthas]] to enjoy the magical and material benefits the position gives them.
