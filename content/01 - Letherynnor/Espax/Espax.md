## History 
The queen of Espax is [[Mikkele IranaÃ«th]], she looks to assert control over all aspects of her kingdom. Ironically, her kingdom is in far worse shape than Otrana when it comes to control. In the north of the kingdom there is near constant turmoil as freedom fighters, bandits, thieves, and vagabonds all fight a continuous battle for ascendancy.

A lot of these groups have very certain ideas about how Espax should be run. They want it broken up into smaller regions, with each region having greater autonomy. A lot of them want their region to be a haven for criminals. They have an obsession with freedom, but the freedom to do what exactly, is unknown. Many people within groups have conflicting goals, and these internal conflicts make the groups easy enough to deal with for the Espaxian Army, which is regimented in 4 cities: Halstead, Precipire, Minas Paxul and Nand.
