## Overview
The adventurers meet at the Alodon docks. They are all taking a ship that tours the cities of Alodon, Bahn Koldur and Laraenthas with the intention of staying in Laraenthas when they arrive there. On the ship the adventurers can meet a group of tieflings on a stag do, and also some high elves these NPC's are important to the campaign or potentially to the adventurer's backstories somehow.

On the ship, there are a group of Tieflings on a stag holiday for the Tiefling groom NPC NAME. They are louty but mostly harmless and shrink away at confrontation, they start playing volleyball with a goblin. There are also a group of elegantly dressed High Elves, who are snooty and look down upon anyone who attempts to interact with them unless they can demonstrate some good knowledge of high society. This will be unlikely on the cheap voyage that this ship provides. These elves are on this ship because it was the last one that was leaving to CITY 2 and they had to be in CITY 2 on urgent business.

On the ship the adventurers also meet each other, or re-meet each other dependant, on character backstories. After they have had the chance to do this, a huge flash of red celestial flame streaks across the sky, this is the attempts of [[The Order of the Ebon Gate]] to summon demons to help them take over the world. They think they can control these demons, or these demons will reward them for summoning them. This brief crack in the fabric of reality causes a complete change in the weather, suddenly a huge storm, the likes of which nobody has seen before starts raging.

The PC's fight to control the ship in the storm and find a way to steer through to dry land. They undergo a skill challenge encounter to steady the ship, whilst also having to fight some monsters that board the sinking ship from the deep, sensing the possibility of blood and food. 

They end up shipwrecked on an island, whether they have seen it or not. Succeeding on the skill challenge allows them more supplies from the Shipwreck, potions of healing, scrolls, money etc. Players also level up to level 2 here.

On this island they are discovered by FEMALE NPC NAME. She is initially hostile and confused about where they came from, can be persuaded to calm down and help the PC's.

On this island there is a survivalist colony, 12 or so people who have survived previous shipwrecks over the past 3-4 years, and now make their home on the island without hope of escape. They are constantly under threat from 2 factions, Goblins and Bullywugs, both native to the islands. The survivalists have to sometimes contend with both factions, sometimes one is more powerful, sometimes another is more powerful. These factions have been at war for control of the island ever since they landed on it. 

The PC's also come under the attack of Kuo-Toa, who should be in the underdark, and this may tip the PC's off about something going on. These Kuo-Toa possess a powerful gem, one of the [[Nasse Lethryn]]. They possess the conjuration Gem, which has allowed them to escape the underdark and the Kuo-Toa, who believe their leader with this Gem to be a God, attack the village and the goblins and the bullywugs, creating yet another faction for the PC's to contend with.

The PC's can deal with this however they want.

Ultimately, the best way for the PC's to escape is to steal this Gem from the Kuo-Toa and use it to escape, however, they will recognise the Gem as powerful and corrupting. Any PC's who handles the Gem to try and use it, will have a significant chance of becoming corrupted. NPC NAME, will volunteer to use the Gem, on the condition that the PC's kill them as soon as they have used it, to prevent that NPC from becoming too powerful.

The PC's can choose to honour that bargain or not, and if they don't there will be consequences in terms of what that NPC becomes, much later down the line.

## The Docks 
### Description 
- The Alodon docks are famously busy in late summer and the activity creates a cacophony of noise in your ears.
- Hauling cargo, selling trade goods and government agents asking about provenance of goods mix into a constant buzz.
- August morning and the sun burns brightly in the sky, yet being as far north as you are, it is a pleasant temperature.
- The wind is blowing in from the sea bringing a fresh, stern scent that whistles on the wind, as do small bits of sea foam that float in the sky like white seeds of the ocean, settling on the ground before they are crushed by the boots of workers and travellers alike.
- A spec in all this noise, a small ship bobs up and down on the sea, carefully tethered to the harbour, The Windhover.
- She has the look of a well travelled ship, but her strength seems unwavering as the sea seems to embrace her as an old friend.
- This ship is being prepared to sail, but there are some last minute passengers still yet to board...
### Introduction of Player Characters
- Delphine 
- Merilyn 
- Morena 
- Zariah

## The Ship
### Description 
- Old and relatively small, but beautifully maintained, clearly a lot of pride goes into taking care of this ship 
- Bright red, black and white horizontally striped sails.
- Footing feels strong underfoot, deck seems to grip to your feet naturally.
- A few shiphands run around from the dock bringing last minute provisions on board in sealed barrels.
- You notice some stronger lockboxes being stowed away after long consultations with the captain
- Middle aged halfling woman with a shaved head and piercingly green eyes, with a mole perched on her shoulder.
- A couple of high elves on board the ship are overseeing things anxiously, speaking in hurried and whispered tones to each other, occasionally glancing upwards to clock the position of the sun.

### Specific Ship NPC's 

#### Mary Brandywood
![[Mary Brandywood]]

### Generic Ship NPC's 
#### Tiefling Group 
###### Description
- Group of 5 tieflings, all tall except for one who is normal height
- All carrying huge bottles of wine and swigging from them liberally
- Jostling and jovial violence going on between them
###### Names and Shirts
Gushoon (Groom) - Hornogrpahy Addict (Bride's name is Belcria - Kilvir's Sister)
Kilvir - Master of the Infernal Regions - Brother
Xaril - Triple D: Devlishly Dressed Demon - Childhood friend
Mavicus - Firey Lover - Used to work together in a pottery workshop
Urcius - Single and Desperate - Xaril's brother, the target of most of the group's jokes
###### Roleplaying
- PIck on Urcius a lot 
- Drunken lads trying to have a good time, generally harmless but Xaril and Mavicus can get a little riled up if provoked.
- Aiming to get to [[Bahn Koldur]], a predominantly dwarven city, allegedly with some of the best nightlife around, or at least that's what they say in [[Alodon]].

#### High Elves 
- Marius Duren and Yvala Ustenn
	- Ostensibly low ranking government officials from [[Aetharian]], were actually sent by a splinter group of wizards in [[Aetharian]] hoping to broker an alliance between [[Otrana]] and [[Aetharian]], which could have far reaching consequences for Aetharian's relationships with [[Espax]].
	- Very concerned about leaving on time, have details in terms of how the negotiations in [[Raelond]] went. Didn't sail from there as to avoid suspicion.
## Setting Sail and the Storm 

### Setting Sail: Description 
- The wind changes, Mary shouts to her small crew to man the sails and takes her place at the helm 
- Cheer goes up from the tieflings and the high elves look relieved.
- Looks at PC's to confirm they are ready to go and leave Alodon and Otrana behind.
- The woosh of the wind thunders into the sails and propels the boat forwards - Mary carefully steers the boat through the immensely busy Alodon dock 
- The high sea awaits, waves undulating and glinting off the early afternoon sun 
- they crash against the prow of the Windhover as she glides along, forging her way through a friendly sea.
- You see Jared squirm across the back of Mary's neck, from shoulder to shoulder excited to be a lookout.
- HAVE TO SUBTLY ESTABLISH WHERE EVERYONE IS STANDING ON THE SHIP.
### Crack in the World and Storm Description 
- The water of the open ocean seems peaceful
- The sun starts to set in the west with a gorgeous orange and pink tint that reflects, sparkling off the waves, gently splashing against the sides of the Windhover 
- Suddenly, the world goes black, not dark, black. The light of the sun seems to be completely extinguished momentarily.
- This is then rapidly followed by a bang, a huge noise, smashing through the sky, audible across the world, and a bright white flash that seems to briefly splinter the very fabric of reality itself. Out of this crack a bright red and black flame bursts, seeming to both project and absorb light at the same time. Against this fabric, you think you see figures flying through the sky.
- You are all thrown to your feet as a shockwave radiates across the sea, and the boat pitches uncontrollably to one side.
- As quickly as it happened, the phenomena seems to dissappear, but the remnants remain, it immediately starts hailing, and not hailing small ice, but large chunks of bright red rock rain from the sky, smashing into the sea around the windhover, which for this brief segment of her existence calls on all of her luck and favour from the sea to not be splintered into a smorgasboard of jagged wood, fabric and iron.
- The rain then comes, thunder and lightning raining overhead and the sky, once pink and orange with a calming hue, turns dark and angry, pelting all those beneath it with a deluge, never before witnessed by any of you.
- The waves swell and now, instead of being friendly, seem to be intent on throwing you to your watery graves.
- Sensing this, you see creatures start to emerge from the sea, and two of them, these half humanoid half fish men, with makeshift spears and nets by their side, clamber onto the boat.
- As they do a wave more aggressive and powerful than the last smashes into the side of the Windhover, and she seems to be desperate, you hear the splinter of wood at her side, and the ship pitches forward dramatically, starting to sink...

#### Loot

#### After the Encounter
 If ship sank how do players get to the island:
	 Meril - Sees a flash of [[Ramiel]] through the clouds and he wishes her to dry land.
	 Delphine - cat drags her on shore
	 Morena - 
	 Sarah - 
## The Island 
South West of the Island is the landing place where the PC's end up. It's broadly circular with two hill ranges that run north to south, multiple streams heading down from these hills. The hill range runs straight north to south with a small gap in the middle where there's a valley between the hills, easier to get through.

The Goblins are encamped to the North of the Island, with their fort on top of one of the hills at the source of a couple of streams. 

The Bullywugs are in the south-east, with their home in a small swamp. They have relatively little in terms of fresh food and water and they survive on what they can find in the swamp. They are definitely under resourced and resources are a big deal in this island.
## The Survivalists 
Survivalists are led by a human woman named Eliana Iraëth (ir-ay-eth).

## How Zariah and Morena get their druidic powers
- Morena - sees a few Mushrooms at the side of the circle, walks over to them and feels some kind of magical energy radiating from them, looking to enter her and use her to transmute itself in the world. Offers her the choice.
- Zariah - sees one singular star as they are sitting round the campfire at night, everyone else sees many, this star, seems to call to her and she feels it offer itself as a source of power to her.
## Introduction to the Village 
- Eliana offers the PC's a tour of the village and asks them if they would like to meet anyone. People are above.
- Eventually she says that she wants to convene a council of strategy with the PC's, Tembral and Greyanna, as to what the plan should be - more manpower arriving all at once means they might have a chance to make some inroads against the goblins and the bullywugs that have been raiding them.
- Eliana says that goblins and bullywugs have little interest in creating, they want to steal and destroy, sadistic in leaving enough people alive to fuel their tribes.
- Make it clear that the Goblins cause the most trouble, they are stronger and tend to be a lot more aggressive. The bullywugs are also bad.
	- Goblins have murdered a lot of the villagers, name them: Bronwyn, Aethlas, Plod, Makaz, Neeza, Recil - "I could go on" - Eliana.
## Buildings in Village 
- Makeshift smithy, more about doing what they can to repair old armour rather than anything else.
- Tavern/Brewery, no mill but there are farms where they can grow vegetables, soldiers hunt and there's a station for where food might be prepared.
- Small planting of grapes to the north of the village.
- A few houses, two human children, young girls running around.
- Village centred around a large campfire that always has at least one attendee, and a big woodstump a few feet away where wood is kept. The wood is sheltered from the wet weather as much as possible.
- Eventually, as it gets dark and the players have discussed possible options with Eliana in terms of a plan, she invites them to sit by the campfire and eat with the villagers.
	- "I can't promise large portions, but I'm not in the habit of starving my friends."
	- "I'm not so blind as to recognise the chance to end our struggles on this island once and for all. I appreciate that we mean nothing to you, but I think you may be our only chance."
## The Kuo-Toa Attack
#### Description
- The PC's sit down by the fire, lots of fish is being grilled, with some makeshift flatbread made from hand-crushed grain. 
- There is homemade wine and relatively flat ale. gentle effervescence on the tongue.
- One of the PC's (whoever has been the quietest sits on a rotting fish placed there by Ava, another prank).
- She runs off giggling to high-five Gushoon, and then starts dancing around the fire. 
- The fish tastes fresh unsurprisingly and the bread is viable as a container, there is a surprisingly decent catch today.
- PC OPPORTUNITY FOR ROLEPLAY - ask them what they do, what they talk about.
- Eventually, Ava passes out and her father Angus gently carries her to the hut. Tembral, Greyanna, Eliana, Mary and Gushoon rotate on watch duties from the north, to the east to the south of the village. Any PC can volunteer for watch duty and they can make a perception check to see the Kuo-Toa coming.
- Suddenly Greyanna stumbles out of the woods from the south, bloody and with a spear in her back. You then hear a piercing scream and a war-cry,  followed by some garbled chanting in a language that sounds like you should be able to understand it, but the words escape you, from the north of the village: "AVA" - Angus Screams and sprints towards the house where he took her. 
- You see rushing into the clearing spears and shields clutched tight and nets hanging of their waists, illuminated by the light of the fire.
- Pale fishlike humanoids, with brown clothes and webbed feet, they look different to what attacked you on the boat. At each contingent's rear, another one of these fish-men with a necklace of teeth, and instead of a spear a staff with a metal contraption on the top resembling a lobster claw.
	- The Kuo-Toa chant "Kopama" - that is the name of the archpriest that has one of the [[Nasse Lethryn]] and has to them, become a God. They found a way out of the underdark and are attacking anyone they can see so their god can retain their aura of power.
	- This gem is used for Dimension door and teleportation.
- 7 kuo-toa and 1 kuo-toa whip from the north and same from the south attack.

#### Loot
40 gold pieces in bits and pieces, small trinkets etc on the Kuo-toa.
#### After the Encounter
- Questions as to where these things came from
- Successful Arcana checks reveal that Kuo-Toa are generally be confined to the Underdark, there may or may not be an entrance
- But also they have sunlight sensitivity and generally avoid the light and above ground, attacking at night is not out of the question but where did they come from. 
- If the players discuss negotiating with the Goblins Eliana basically says that they all just want control of the island, the goblins want people to produce food for them etc. They could maybe be swayed by offering them a way out of the island but who knows if they wouldn't stab us in the back at any point.
- The Bullywugs are happy with their swamp, they catch most of their food, they just act up because the Goblins have threatened them and they're trying to get stronger in response to the threat, they also view the humans as a threat and the humans view them as a threat, both sides have killed. Would take string neogtiations to reach a peace settlement.
- Some villagers like the tranquility of the island, they might be a bit harder to convince to leave it, if the players want to offer the island to one of the factions in return for help removing the other - those villagers are:
	- Haltran 
	- Greyanna
	- Semagu 
	- Adun
## The Bullywugs 
The bullywugs are led by a Beserker called [[Meldram Cardun]]. He was the former husband of [[Ella Plainchant]]. He joined the [[The Golden Moon|cult of The Golden Moon]]. They blackmailed him essentially and gave Ella a chance to get away, they were threatening him that they would kill him and Ella and take their children anyway, so he decided that the best option was to make peace with the idea.

But his children were taken from him as soon as they got their hands on them. Meldram was driven insane as they kept them from him, before eventually teleporting him away, after he made one last desperate attempt to save them, where he luckily was blown to the island.

Thought that by pretending to have gone willingly he would be kept in the loop, but he was made a lackey of the cult and the children taken from him.
After 20 years, he made one last desperate attempt to save his children, but found them to be completely indoctrinated into the cult.
They teleported him away somewhere completely random, and he ended up in the Bullywug swamp.

## The Goblins 

### Goblin Scouting Party 
#### Overview
The players may want to see if they can deal with any Goblins/Bullywugs roaming the island. If they do so they can get more details on the Goblin camp.
#### Description

- Goblin scouting party consists of 5 goblins and 1 goblin boss.
- Goblins laughing and joking with each other in Goblin.
- Whenever one of the goblins speaks they go very quiet and listen intently.

#### Loot

#### After the Encounter
Leader of the goblins is called Harold. The goblins were outcasts of a larger goblin tribe called The Embergrin Tribe. Harold tried to start a rebellion against the current leadership after he was cheated out of a share of treasure, a simple raid on a caravan. This escalated and became an open rebellion. He was defeated and the goblins paid the Stormcoast Otrana, a pirate organisation to dump them somewhere. The pirates dumped them on this island about 3 years ago and they've been just about surviving ever since.  
Around 20-25 goblins total at the Goblin encampment, on top of one of the hills in the north, well hidden by some dense trees and bushes.
Lots of traps around the camp - spike traps in front of the gate.

## The Portal
#### Overview
If the players choose to tell the Goblins about the Kuo-Toa and they successfully convince the Goblins to help with the fighting of them, you can create an encounter between the Goblins and the Kuo-Toa. 

When the encounter is over, the portal remains open for 15 minutes or so, the players can choose at that point to enter into the underdark and leave the islanders behind. DC10 Arcana check allows the players to use the portal and they are dropped straight into another encounter as the Kuo-Toa watch from the watchtowers.
#### Description
- Sun goes down 
- Make them wait and RP between themselves and the Goblins 
- The Goblins will want to leave and maybe require some persuasion checks to stay 
- But suddenly the ground starts glowing a deep purple - chanting emanates from the ground and 6 kuo-toa suddenly phase into existence within the portal, which remains glowing.

#### After the Encounter
PC's can elect to go through the portal with a successful DC10 Arcana check 

## How to Get Through the Portal
- The portal remains open for a short period of time after the Kuo-Toa leave it.
- The way to get through is to either Ambush them there or follow through quickly. Both pose risks.
- If they come up with some other cool idea, let it work.
- Entrance to the portal, is located in the front of a large underdark stronghold. The Kuo-Toa have taken this thing over using the power of the gem.
- See a that they are next to a river, which leads into the front of a castle, the river flows in through a large gate, that looks like it should contain a portcullis, but instead icy white stalactites hang down precariously, two other openings either side of it are set against rocky and precarious terrain where the faintest misstep could send you plunging into the icy depths of the black water that flows stealthily into the fortress.
- The PC's see a magical stream of purple energy, that flows around an equivalent stone circle in the underdark, they can follow the trace of this purple energy to find the location of the gem.

### Library - Bear Puzzle from Whispering Burrows
Statues are arranged in a circle. Clockwise from the top:

Dragon,
Lion,
Bear,
Eagle,
Wolf
##### Description
In the library you see 5 statues made of dark stone.
They are statutes of a Dragon, a Lion, a Bear, an Eagle and a Wolf.

Looking for a book with successful DC 15 arcana or investigation checks.

Each of them has in front of them a potion bottle, each with a mysterious yellow liquid glowing inside of it. 
  
The eagle has no poison in it's beak,
Drink from the wolf and your strong legs remain,
Sadly the dragon has not what you seek,
One neighbour stops your sight and one causes pain.
The bear will let you move at will,
And for the dragon, poison is not for him to spill,

When the adventurers drink the correct potion the door opens
