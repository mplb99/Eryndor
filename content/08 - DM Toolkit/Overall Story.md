- There is a massive, but brief crack in the material plane - a huge flash across the sky
- This has come from a group called [[The Order of the Ebon Gate]] who are trying to summon the soul of the [[High Mage Ebon Vairae]]  in order to take over the world.
- Her soul is so powerful and evil that it could not be summoned, but making the first attempt at doing so has opened a crack in the world, through which many devils and demons and maybe a part of Vairae's soul have poured through.
- [[The Order of the Ebon Gate]] are trying to reunite the soul and the body of the great mage Ebon Vairae. As her last act before she was defeated by a huge army of Otrana and Espax, she severed her soul from her body and left it to rot in a place unknown to man. The Order of the Ebon Gate are trying to reunite her soul with her body and believe the person who does so will be rewarded with eternal life and power from Vairae. At the height of her power, Vairae was powerful enough to take on the entire world. This would also be known by the mages in [[Aetharian]]. 
- The cult is broadly known by the kingdoms of [[Otrana]] and [[Espax]]. Not in high leadership but in lower courts and local governments. They are in a state of inaction. Partially in disbelief as [[High Mage Ebon Vairae|Vairae]] is so lost to legend that many believe this to be entirely made up. Each kingdom thinks that they can probably harness the cult against the other and believe them to be a powerful weapon of war potentially. Cultists are interested both in sowing discord and uncovering the body of Vairae. Probably a lot of magic where she was buried.
- Whichever one the PC's go to (Otrana), that is the kingdom that is trying to do that, the other kingdom is unaware. 
- Espax have problems of their own with a rebellion from a morally questionable libertarian rebel group, seem like freedom fighters. The government of Espax is very controlling, and the rebels represent the antithesis of this. Players could side with these rebels or players could side with the government or try and find a compromise.
- Aetharian split from Espax in a relatively peaceful split around 100 years ago, peace has been maintained by the great wizards of that region who offer their services to Espax government officials in return for effective self-determination. Of course there are some wizards who disagree with that and think they should break away from Espax entirely, but a an alliance and good shipping would need to be worked out at least with Kagarum and potentially with Otrana to do that. However, making an alliance with Espax's great rival is an incredibly risky geo-political move, so the Aetharian wizards are divided on this. They don't like Espax because they can be controlling and were often heavy handed in their attitude to magical experimentation.
- There was a powerful wizarding group called [[Varya Lethryn]], formed soon after the creation of the world that created 8 magical gems, whose power was harnessed by Adamantine Sceptres. The gems were imperfect and took on a will of their own, aiming to darken the hearts of those who used them without these sceptres in place - Kuo Toa have got their hands on one of these gems Gems - Conjuration gem - so they can teleport in and out of the Underdark, they found a way to get up to the island that the players found themselves shipwrecked on.
- Vairae lived before these gems but has watched their creation from an unknown inaccessible plain. She only ever had one other companion - a cat named Dante.
- A part of her soul lives inside Dante, Cultists will try and gain this information as they believe that it could be harnessed by them to both find the body of Vairae, and start a ritual to bring her back.
