## Description

## Roleplaying and Signature Lines

## Relationships

## Motivations
- Involved with the [[The Kaname Madoka]]. Interested in syphoning off people's life forces, takes more of an interest in [[Involond]] because it is slightly more 'wild-west'-y than [[Laraenthas]], and she can carry out some of her experiments there unperturbed.
