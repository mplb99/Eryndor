## Description
[[High Mage Ebon Vairae]] was one of the members of the [[Varya Lethryn]]. She corrupted each of the [[Nasse Lethryn]] with a piece of her own soul, which was unknown to the rest of the [[Varya Lethryn]] who made the objects. They were eventually unknowlingly corrupted and Vairae continued to gain power, her mission was to cut off all magic from 'normal' people, remove all elements of magic from the world and make it so that those who did not have any magic should learn to fend for themselves. She eventually hoped to enslave them as her servants and syphon off their life force and energy to fund even greater magical experiments.
