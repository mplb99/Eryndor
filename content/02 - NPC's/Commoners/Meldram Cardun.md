## Description
- Small dwarf, large red beard and braided red hair.
- Speaks basic Bullywug now that he has lived with them for a few weeks.
## Roleplaying and Signature Lines
- Got himself into involvements with the Cult trying to prove to [[Ella Plainchant]] that he could care for their family.
- 4 children - Angie, Dimmora, Arryl, Branmir
- Cult blackmailed him, they wanted his children. Said they would kill them all, including him and Ella, if he didn't comply.
- Figured that the best solution was to pretend to go willingly. Left Ella a note telling her to run, but not explaining anything else. Wrote the note pretending to join the cult willingly.
- Thought that by pretending to have gone willingly he would be kept in the loop, but he was made a lackey of the cult and the children taken from him.
- After 20 years, he made one last desperate attempt to save his children, but found them to be completely indoctrinated into the cult.
- They teleported him away somewhere completely random, and he ended up in the Bullywug swamp.
## Relationships
- Former husband of [[Ella Plainchant]].
