## Description
- Shaved head and bright green eyes
- Mole perched on her shoulder - Mole is called Jared
- Dressed very practically, short cropped cloak over a sturdy dark ensemble.
- Heavy clad boots that seem to burrow their way into the metal
## Roleplaying and Signature Lines
- Jovial but turns quickly to serious in certain situations.
- Honourable, very much about finish what you start.
- Lines for when she meets each of the PC's:
	- Delphine - I hope you're not suggesting by bringing your lovely friend here on board that you think my ships ridden with vermin are you?
	- Merilyn - haha, I didn't rub a magic lamp in my sleep did I?
	- Morena - brilliant, a friend.
	- Zariah - More elves, less likely to be troublemakers I've found.
- "On my ship, you behave yourself and you keep the sea on our side."
- "I loved once, but now the cold sea fills my soul more wholly than the warmest love ever could."
## Relationships
- Former lover of [[Casey Shortshanks]] - didn't work out, because Mary wanted to sail the seas and Casey wanted to remain rooted to the land.
## Motivations
- Small Business Owner - Brandywood Shipping Company - recently bought this ship - has a few journeys on her already - second hand, bought from a larger shipping company [[HardBoat]].
- Doesn't really want to grow her business, but wants to create a sustainable source of income for herself.
- Great shame is that she was not honourable, was spurned by a lover in Riverrun, Casey Shortshanks, she rejected Mary and Mary was so distraught that she ran away, hasn't spoken or heard from Casey in 10 years but has never gotten over her.
