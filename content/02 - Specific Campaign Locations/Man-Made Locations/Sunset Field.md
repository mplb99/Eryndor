[[Thulemere]]: West of [[Bramblebrook Farm]] and across the [[Dramur River|Dramur]] from the town of  [[Nettlebridge]]. 

## Overview
Owned By: [[Llewella Finnagund]] and [[May Finnagund]].
## Description
Sunset Field basks in the golden hues of approaching dusk, its fertile land cradled by the gentle curves of the [[Dramur River]]. A quaint farmhouse, its walls constructed from a whimsical mix of cobblestone and timber, gleams in the dying sunlight. Here, [[May Finnagund]], a kobold with fiery red scales and a glint of mischief in her eyes, works the land alongside her wife [[Llewella Finnagund]], a graceful half-elf with sun-kissed skin and windblown hair. Their farm, unlike its neighbours, hums with an air of unconventional prosperity. Exotic flowers bloom in vibrant defiance of the usual crops, while plump, healthy livestock graze contentedly. The melodic clanging of May's hammer against metal often mingles with Llewella's lilting songs, creating a unique symphony that echoes across the Dramur's banks.
