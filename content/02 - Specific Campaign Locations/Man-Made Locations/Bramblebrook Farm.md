## Overview
Owned By: [[Samsfeld Bramblebrook]]

## Description
Settled amidst gently rolling hills just beyond the watchful gaze of the Podram Hills, the farmhouse of Bramblebrook Farm looks to be the picture of prosperity. A bright red tiled roof stands in contrast to the yellows of the wheat fields and the green of the animal fields. Just beyond the farm, you see the beautiful blue of Dramur Lake, as the sun sets to your left, sending shimmering sparkles across the water.
