## Overview
Owned By: [[Longo Puddlefoot]] and [[Neela Puddlefoot]].
## Description
  
Owlfeather Farm stretches across the rolling hills, a patchwork of unremarkable fields bathed in the current sunlight. A weathered farmhouse, its paint faded and patched in a haphazard manner, sits nestled amidst a cluster of outbuildings. [[Longo Puddlefoot]], a man perpetually dusted with hay and etched with worry lines, toils tirelessly in the fields alongside his wife [[Neela Puddlefoot|Neela]]. Their farm yields enough to keep them fed and clothed, but little more. The air hangs heavy with the earthy scent of freshly tilled soil and the distant bleating of sheep - a symphony of the ordinary.
