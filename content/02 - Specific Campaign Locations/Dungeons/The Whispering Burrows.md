## Location

[[The Whispering Burrows]] entrance is located near [[Bramblebrook Farm]] against the [[Podram Hills]].
## Description - Entrance

The beam of light illuminates the rock face, which as you approach seems to morph and turn into an archway painted onto the stone. There are no distinguishing markings around it, just a solid line of silver light formed into a 20 foot high and 15 foot wide arch.

A player has to press their hand against the wall and say the phrase: "I shall touch the void."

Once they do that the entrance to the dungeon opens and the wolves stop attacking.
## History

The Whispering Burrows is a dungeon created by the Tel'Erin Eldorion. It is designed to imprison anyone who comes after the [[Necromancy - Boneweaver's Cradle|Boneweaver's Cradle]] a Shard of the Void located deep within the dungeon.

## Level 1 - Room 1

#### Overview

This room is the entrance room where each player will be required to give up something magical in order to proceed. Could be a spell slot, or a magical item, or a potion.
##### Description

You descend the stairs and enter a room that has impressive grandeur for something that seems so ancient. The stone floor seems in impeccable condition and magical blue light, emanating from torches set into the wall, light your path. you come to a doorway, which as you approach slowly releases and slides down into the floor.

Before you is a room. Your eyes are immediately drawn to a large statue, the colour of which has not faded, and remains bright and clear, if slightly eerie in the pale blue light. It is a statue of a Dragonborn, with long flowing deep blue robes descending down to the floor, and a crest that you don't recognise emblazoned on the left breast. The Dragonborn itself is coloured in Dark green with piercing white eyes.

The silence is palpable, broken only by your boots hitting the cobbled floor, and the occasional scratching of metal in the distance.

Around you, you notice a mosaic stretching around the walls, with draconic language captioning a panel every now and then.
(STOP)
###### The Mosaic 
There are around 8 panels. Each of which depicts a different scene with a different caption. 
The first panel is labelled: "Formation". And you see an image of what looks like the creation of the world. 
The second is labelled "Friendship" and shows a Dragonborn, a Gnome and a halfling walking side by side away from you down a road, through a forest.
The third is labelled "Knowledge", and shows the same creatures pouring over a series of books.
The fourth is labelled "Community", this time there are 8 people, all sitting round a circular table, with the same blue robes you see on the statue.
The fifth is labelled "Creation". It shows each of these members standing side by side facing you, each holds a deep purple and black gem. These gems seem to suck in the colours of those around them, so that the area around each gem seems faded, with the gems standing out more boldly as a result.
The sixth is labelled "Corruption". You see each of the figures arguing, with depictions of magical spells, flying between them.
The seventh is labelled "Protection". You see a Dragonborn, the same one in the statue, alone this time, walking away from a dark room with the Gem inside.
The eighth and final panel is labelled "Removal". You see the same 8 figures, united again, in the midst of ascension upwards into a portal of some sorts.
###### Approaching the Statue 
As you approach the statue you notice a pedestal in front of it, as you get closer you hear a booming voice in each of your heads.

"Congratulations, adventurers. You have proven yourselves in your quick wit and thought. But it is one thing to solve ancient puzzles. It is another to show true worthiness of the immense power that resides in these Whispering Burrows. Are you worthy?"

If the adventurers answer in the affirmative the statue will ask each of them to recount a story of when they did something good for other people.

If the statue is satisfied, he will continue:

"You seem virtuous, but true virtue demands sacrifice. I ask for one piece of magic from each of you, then you will be permitted to pass and face the trials of the Burrows."
#### Encounter/Puzzle

The adventurers can sacrifice anything magical, a spell slot, a potion, an item, anything as long as it has some magical properties.

## Level 1 - Room 2
#### Overview
This room looks like an arena, painted on the walls are crowds and a fence. It looks to all intents and purposes like you could be in a colloseum of some sort.
##### Description

This room, is empty, the floor suddenly seems dusty instead of cobblestone, and you hear before you see, two small dark waterfalls in the far corners of the room. There is another mosaic encircling you, and this one looks like a great battle arena. Wooden grandstands seem to tower above you, and in the southeast corner, you see a dark archway with what looks like a pair of menacing eyes, gleaming purple through the darkness.

(STOP)

###### Approach that Area
As you approach the dark passageway, the darkness rolls back, the eyes appear gone. The stone instead, looks like a door, but set into the wall itself. There appears to be no handle.
#### Encounter/Puzzle
A Champion, that only activates after the trap in room 4 has been sprung.
```statblock
monster: Champion 
```
The Champion awaits the person in Room 3, if the players in Room 4 are killed, and they need to escape.
#### Loot
100 gp

## Level 1 - Room 3

#### Overview
This room has the look of a library, triggering the trap in room 4 will cause magical runes to appear. The player who is trapped in this room has to press the runes that appear on the books, as they are described to them by the other players. 
##### Description 

This room has the look of a library, the mosaic on the walls is of faded books, and bookshelves, with scrolls draped down them. The floor, has a gentle purple glow that surrounds every imprint your boots make, and you hear an echoing that you would expect to hear in a room 20 times the size.

#### Encounter/Puzzle
 The Runes:

#### Loot

## Level 1 - Room 4
#### Overview
As all but one player steps into the room, the door locks and the players are trapped inside. The door to  Room 3 Locks as well. The edges of Room 4 fill with fire, fire which slowly grows further in towards the players with every failed rune the player in room 3 touches.
##### Description

This room has the look of a crypt. You see around you, a few skeletons on the floor, in stark contrast to the other rooms. There is no mosaic on the wall, no colour anywhere, and the torches that have lit your way thus far seem to be dimmer as well. You see on the far side of the wall, a door, similar in that it's set stone to the one in the second room, this one however, has some writing that you can't quite make out over the top of it, and what appears to be a metal door knocker in the middle of it.

## Whispering Burrows - Level 2

Have to remember that the overall theme of Level 2 is about weakening the players until they can confront the Death Warlock in the last room. He wants them weakened not dead, and he wants worthy servants for his undead army, rather than people who were too stupid or weak to get passed the traps.

## Whispering Burrows - Level 2, Room 2
#### Overview
Puzzle, players have to convince a talking cauldron to accept the food it doesn't initially think it will like, in order to allow the door to open.
##### Description
You enter what appears to be a kitchen. There is a 10 foot long, dark wooden table in the middle of the room, adorned with various foodstuffs. At the end of the room there is  a fireplace, with a cauldron hanging over an unlit pile of logs. To the right hand side of this is a door.

(Table)
On the table you see:
A pig's head with an apple in it's mouth
A pie with what appear to be birds feet and beaks sticking out of the crust
A huge loaf of bread, next to a slab of cheddar cheese
A whole salmon, it's skin opened up to reveal it's pink meat
An apple tart
A pile of salt
A pepper shaker
Honey roast duck.
Cups of mead.
Nice bottle of wine.

#### Encounter/Puzzle
The door at the end of the room is locked. To proceed the players have to light the fire underneath the cauldron. This brings the cauldron to life and it will start asking for the players to feed it things, however, any time the players give the cauldron something it likes, it explodes in a burst of fire, dealing 4d6 fire damage to the player who fed it that item. The cauldron will reject any item the player throws at it that it doesn't like, spitting it straight back out. 

The players have to convince the cauldron to try the food it doesn't like. Once each player has tried to convince the cauldron to try something, and the cauldron has accepted it, the door will open.

## Whispering Burrows - Level 2, Room 5
#### Overview
The players enter a long room. The only doors are the two doors at the end, DO NOT INCLUDE the door on the left.
##### Description
You enter a long room, as you walk forwards torches, light themselves up alongside your footsteps. Ahead you see an altar with a small stone knife lying on top of it. You also see a small stone tablet with 4 separate pieces, it's arranged in a square cut into 4 quarters with a line straight down the middle vertically and a line straight down the middle horizontally. In the top left quadrant are two fixed stones saying "YES" and "NO".  On the altar are two stones reading "JA" and "DA", which look like they will fit into the quadrant and complete it. Written on the base of the altar is an inscription.

On the altar you read:

Proceeding this way is a dangerous folly:

Behold three Gods. One always speaks the truth, one always lies and the other speaks either falsehoods or actualities, totally at the will of the randomness of the world. To pass you must slash the God who speaks falsehoods in the throat, to silence his wicked ways, the God who speaks at his fancy in the arm, to teach him a lesson and you must kiss the foot of the God who speaks only truths. You must also leave the translation of the words for future adventurers to know.

You may ask three questions, each question may be asked to one God and one God only, but you may ask a God as many questions as you like, for they are generous beings. 

However, they will not speak your language - they will reply either Ja or Da, a language of their own devising which is unknown to all mortal beings. Maybe Ja means no and Da means yes or maybe Da means yes and ja means no, it would be foolish to guess.

Should you kill or hurt the truthful god, the others will be set free and will see themselves hell bent on your destruction.

"Three gods A, B, and C are called, in no particular order, True, False, and Random. True always speaks truly, False always speaks falsely, but whether Random speaks truly or falsely is a completely random matter. Your task is to determine the identities of A, B, and C by asking three [yes–no questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes%E2%80%93no_question "Yes–no question"); each question must be put to exactly one god. The gods understand English, but will answer all questions in their own language, in which the words for _yes_ and _no_ are _da_ and _ja_,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardest_Logic_Puzzle_Ever#cite_note-3) in some order. You do not know which word means which."

#### Encounter/Puzzle
Three Stone Golems guard the way to the next gate, they carry stone tablets in their hands.
```statblock
monster: Stone Golem
```

Players only have to fight the false and random stone Golem if they fail the puzzle.

THE ANSWER:

Room looks like this:

![[Whispering_Burrows_Golem_Puzzle_Room.png]]
Left hand as we look at it: FALSE 
Middle as we look at it: RANDOM  - Roll a die - odd number means FALSE response, even number means TRUE response
Right as we look at it: TRUE
Da == NO
Ja == YES

#### Loot
Either defeating the Stone Golems in battle or solving the puzzle earns the players the Stone Golem's bounty of 5000gp. (If they solve it by luck then they only get 500gp).

## Whispering Burrows - Level 2, Room 6
#### Overview

Puzzle - Players read a series of obituaries and have to re-enact how the people within the graves died.
##### Description

Opposite the graves there is a table, with a large stone tablet in the middle of it, surrounding the tablet seem to be a random assortment of everyday items: they include two large sticks, a painting of a topless bearded dwarven lady, some rope, a large barrel with 1971 etched on the side, some handcuffs, an empty bottle of wine, a blunt rusty sword, a bottle of grease.

Opposite the graves is a tablet, written in multiple languages, they do not say the name but the fact that the names are written in different languages should be the hint.

1st Paragraph - Infernal - Trimming his hedge and unexpectedly encountered his own face foliage, fell on his sword.

2nd Paragraph - Draconic - So drunk and obsessed with his own reflection, he did not notice his son slowly eating him.

3rd - Paragraph - Leonin - Writhed in self pleasure over the cliff

Dragon,
Lion,
Bear,
Eagle,
Wolf
##### Description
In the room you see 5 statues made of dark stone. 

They are statutes of a Dragon, a Lion, a Bear, an Eagle and a Wolf.

Each of them has in front of them a potion bottle, each with a mysterious yellow liquid glowing inside of it. As you step into the room, you hear a booming voice inside your head:

Welcome adventurers, to the final challenge. One of the potions you see before you will let you pass. One will leave you unable to move, one will cause great agony, one will stop your sight and one will leave you poisoned. Listen carefully:

The eagle has no poison in it's beak,
Drink from the wolf and your strong legs remain,
Sadly the dragon has not what you seek,
One neighbour stops your sight and one causes pain.
The bear will let you move at will,
And for the dragon, poison is not for him to spill,

And now you have all you need, if your wits are sharp,
To touch the void and embrace the dark.


When the adventurers drink the correct potion, a dark portal opens up in the middle of the circle, through which they can jump and enter into the final room.
#### Loot

1000gp (100 deducted for every hint.)




## Whispiering Burrows - Level 3 - Boss Battle

#### Overview

The players enter a huge cavern, deathlock mastermind is on a platform that is being held up and the entire thing shielded by energy being absorbed by 8 humanoi creatures on either side of the map. There are shadows guarding these creatures, and the players will have to destroy them in order to make progress. The Deathlock Mastermind on the first turn of combat summons a Horned Devil to fight for him.

The ghouls are non magical entities, they are being harvested by the Deathlock Mastermind to prevent itself being damaged. Any ranged attack against the Deathlock Mastermind will bounce off the shield these ghouls create. Players can kill the ghouls, but if they disturb them without destroying them, they can break the spell and these ghouls will help them in the fight? Can add in this mechanic if things are getting rough. If things are easy, then
