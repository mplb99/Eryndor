## Description
Unlike most woodlands, Dramwood boasts no verdant hues. Here, the trees stand like silent sentinels, their bark imbued with a deep, rich color - the color of dark whiskey or aged brandy. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the dense canopy, casting the forest floor in an perpetual amber gloom. The only sounds are the occasional rustle of unseen creatures and the melancholic sigh of the wind whispering secrets through the russet leaves. Dramwood radiates an air of mystery, a place where shadows seem to writhe with unseen life and the very air carries the faintest tang of fermented magic.
