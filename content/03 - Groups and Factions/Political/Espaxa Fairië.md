## Overview
The Espaxa Fairië are a group of Elvish freedom fighters, fighting for the freedom of the Kingdom of Espax. Angry about the cutting down of sacred elven trees in the Kargash Forests by both Orcs and people from Oradon. Want the freedom to do something about that, but are not allowed to do it by the queen of Espax: [[Mikkele Iranaëth]].

They are essentially fantasy NIMBY's. They protest about the cutting down of sacred elven trees, when in reality the trees are relatively extraneous to the core tenets of their original religion. The orcs do invade their homeland from time to time, and they are bitter about not receiving help from the Espaxians, but they do also tend to reject any trade or attempt at cultural integration with the people of Oradon. 

They refuse to let them use their land to even pass through and the people of Oradon have not taken to this kindly, trespassing and cutting down trees against the wishes of the elves. The Espaxian government has taken the side of Oradon and is giving their lumberjacks and farmers protection when they enter into Espaxia Farie lands.
