## Overview
The howling legion are a group of mercenaries and thugs, who call themselves freedom fighters. They believe in physical dominance and power. They believe caring for those less fortunate than yourself to be a sign of weakness, and they seek to establish a two tiered society where the physcially strong dominate and the weak are left to be servants or ignored altogether.
