## Overview
Operating primarily on the outskirts of [[Olboz]], and in the hills between [[Olboz]] and [[Halstead]], the Pyrebloods are led by the Ash Prophet. They believe that the current monarchy and the Church of [[The Virtuous Divines]] have overstepped their religious mandate. In most cities in espax, temples that are not temples of [[The Virtuous Divines]] are poorly maintained and receive little government help.

They want freedom of religion, to worship the dragon [[Forzaantilirys]]. They have brutal rituals that they believe brings themselves closer to the dragon.

There are two factions within the Pyrebloods, one call themselves the Escapists and the others the Harbingers. The escapists want to use magical power to escape to the plane where they believe [[Forzaantilirys]] to be fighting Bahamut in an eternal struggle between good and evil. They wish to help [[Forzaantilirys]] and then live on this plane, worshipping him and acting as his servants.

The harbingers however, want to bring [[Forzaantilirys]] into this world, ending the conflict between good and evil and letting [[Forzaantilirys]] wring his havoc upon this world.
