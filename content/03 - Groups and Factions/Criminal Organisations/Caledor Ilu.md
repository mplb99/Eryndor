## Overview
The Caledor Ilu are an outright chaotic evil underground criminal wizard organisation, involved in a lot of criminal activity in [[Aetharian]].
## Leadership
Uniform is lime green. A lot of the youth of the poorer parts of the city think it's cool to be wearing these kinds of things, so they wear them regardless.
## Members
1. **Mordryn Blackflame**
   - **Role:** Head of Arcane Research
   - **Description:** Mordryn is a tall, gaunt human with jet-black hair and eyes that burn with an eerie, unnatural fire. His skin is pale, almost sickly, and he dresses in dark, flowing robes adorned with arcane symbols. Known for his ruthless pursuit of forbidden knowledge, Mordryn oversees the experimentation and development of dark magical practices, often pushing the boundaries of what even the Caledor Ilu consider acceptable.

2. **Vesra Ravant**
   - **Role:** Master of Infiltration and Espionage
   - **Description:** Vesra is a lithe and deadly tiefling woman with midnight-blue skin and sharp, silver horns that curve back over her head. Her eyes are a piercing shade of crimson, and she is always dressed in sleek, shadowy attire that allows her to blend into the darkness. Vesra is an expert in subterfuge, skilled in the art of gathering secrets and manipulating others to do the Caledor Ilu’s bidding without ever realizing it.

3. **Molana Duskwraith**
   - **Role:** Keeper of Forbidden Tomes
   - **Description:** Kaelith, a half-elf with ashen-gray skin and haunting, pale blue eyes, is the guardian of the Caledor Ilu's vast collection of dark and forbidden texts. He is a reclusive figure, spending most of his time deep within the labyrinthine archives of the organization. Kaelith’s knowledge of ancient and dangerous spells makes him a respected, if feared, member of the group. His presence is often accompanied by a faint whispering that unnerves those around him.

4. **Tharvok Bloodrend**
   - **Role:** Enforcer and Executioner
   - **Description:** Tharvok is a massive orc with greenish-gray skin, blood-red eyes, and an intimidating physique. His face is scarred from countless battles, and he wears heavy armor adorned with spikes and dark runes. Tharvok is the muscle of the Caledor Ilu, responsible for carrying out their most brutal tasks. His reputation as a relentless and merciless executioner ensures that few dare to cross the organization.

5. **Lirana Vex**
   - **Role:** Mistress of Illusions and Deception
   - **Description:** Lirana is a captivating elven woman with platinum blonde hair and eyes that shift in color, reflecting her mastery of illusion magic. Her beauty is only surpassed by her ability to weave complex illusions that can deceive even the most perceptive minds. Lirana specializes in creating false realities to trap or mislead the enemies of the Caledor Ilu, often to devastating effect. Her charm and cunning make her both dangerous and unpredictable.

6. **Zarath Darkvein**
   - **Role:** Alchemist and Poison Master
   - **Description:** Zarath is a wiry gnome with wild, dark hair streaked with gray and skin that has taken on a sickly, yellowish hue from years of working with toxic substances. His eyes are an unsettling shade of green, and he is always seen in a stained alchemist’s coat. Zarath is a genius when it comes to crafting potent poisons and deadly concoctions, providing the Caledor Ilu with a wide array of lethal tools to use against their enemies.

7. **Ishara Voidgaze**
   - **Role:** Seer and Diviner
   - **Description:** Ishara is a mysterious, veiled half-drow woman with deep purple skin and glowing, white eyes that seem to peer into the very soul. She is often cloaked in layers of dark, flowing fabrics that conceal her form, adding to her enigmatic presence. Ishara’s abilities in divination allow the Caledor Ilu to predict the movements of their enemies and manipulate future events to their advantage. Her cryptic prophecies are highly valued by the organization’s leaders.
