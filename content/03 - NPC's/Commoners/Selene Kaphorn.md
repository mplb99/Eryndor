## Description

Selene is a young half-orc woman, clearly from a working background. She has a hardened but friendly face, often contorted into an expression of intense focus. She is most comfortable when doing  skilled manual labour, any kind of dress-up or formal event makes her nervous.

In [[Vampiric Brambles and Haunted Brooks]] she is wearing standard farmhand attire, looking quite exhausted after a days working in the farm.
## Roleplaying
