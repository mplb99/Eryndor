## Description

[[Derek Higginbotham]] is a man around 5"11, and quite squat and round. His chain mail seems just slightly poorly fitting, but his eyes are alert. On his back is a bright green emerald cloak, emblazoned with a Hammer and Longbow overlapping in gold print.

Used to live in the village of Sildurgriding until it was destroyed by the dragon Feurbane. He had many lovers in the village, both male and female, despite his perceived mediocrity. When they had to flee, he was asked by many people, a few of whom took exception to his ignoring them and started hiring assassins to come after him. He decided that the only way to avoid being killed was to train with the Brizar mercenaries and now he travels with them, wearing their signature bright emerald cloak, with a longbow and a hammer emblazoned on the back.
## Roleplaying

- Initially quite hostile and driven
- Opens up with the tragedy of his life after getting to know people
- Used to be a cobbler in the town of [[Sildurgriding]]
- Town was destroyed by the dragon [[Feurbane]].
- Everyone fled the town, hoping to seek refuge in the dwarvern kingdom of [[Durakarn]], but the dwarves refused them.
- Some villages in [[Silmarien]] took them in, but the majority headed to [[Aethalia]], where the former neighbours went their separate ways.
- Silgurgriding was a bit of a casanova, and took many lovers in this small village. Some of these former lovers were quite hurt when he didn't choose to go with them, instead looking to the city of [[Eldoria]] to continue his life.
- They started hiring assassins from various criminal gangs to track him down and kill him, but by luck he managed to escape these.
- Eventually decided that the only way he was going to get away from the assassins was to join the [[The Brizar|Brizar]], a gang of mercenaries, and that is what he has been doing for the last 3 years.
- He has not had many serious missions and this is his first solo outing.
