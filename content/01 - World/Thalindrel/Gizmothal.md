## Brief Overview 

Gizmothal is a Gnomish settlement in the north of [[Thalindrel]]. The Gnomes there are quite poor and often are either blackmailed or kidnapped by gangs from the forest of [[Calenwyr]]. These gangs then either enslave or recruit the gnomes to create things for them. Some people in Gizmothal see this as an honour to be chosen, and your only ticket out, some see it as the very thing keeping the village down.
