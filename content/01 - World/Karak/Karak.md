## Description

A primarily dwarvish kingdom in the North, this mountain based place with caves and tunnels running deep, offers plenty of work for anyone interested in mining precious stones or materials. Some races prefer this work more than others of course. Karak is generally open and friendly with the occasional "bad egg", often looking to expand trade with their neighbours and suitably enjoying the delicacies from above ground they receive in return.
