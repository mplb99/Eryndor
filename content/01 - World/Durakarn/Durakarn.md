## Description

Primarily a Dwarvish kingdom in the north east, they are more isolated when compared to [[Karak]]. They are only skeptical of visitors rather than hostile. They spend a lot of their time in the southern part of the mountain range around the lake, which they call [[Kerkarn Lake]]. There are many rumours of precious metals, which they yearn to find, although they often have trouble mining due to the many underground lakes and rivers that they encounter. Although, these lakes and rivers make for excellent transportation of the materials when they are found.
