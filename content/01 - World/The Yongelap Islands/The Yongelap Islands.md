## Description

A series of islands located to the west of [[Aethalia]]. The people here are generally very spiritual with their own system of belief and government. The islands composing these places are called [[Yamoltrek]], [[Ulithi]], [[Fais]], [[Truk]], and [[Kosrae]]. Relatively little is written and documented about these places, they are rumoured to be hostile to all but the most trusted of outsiders, but occasionally for important reasons they will ventrue from their lands. They haven't been seen in Aethalia since the [[Great Hurricane of 3417]].
