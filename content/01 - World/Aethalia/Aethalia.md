## Description
Aethalia is the human kingdom within [[01 - Eryndor|Eryndor]], founded in 563 of the Second Age. It has grown and expanded to the point where now it encompasses a significant part of the west coast of  [[01 - Eryndor|Eryndor]]. It contains four regions.

- [[Nova Stara]], capital [[Lurendal]].
- [[Lothariel]], capital [[Quel'Arnor]].
- [[Thulemere]], capital [[Ta'Rag]].
- [[Ela'Siril]], capital [[Peldrith]].

Each of these regions has their own capital, and while they are not self governing and report to the King or Queen of Aethalia, they have as much autonomy as there is lack of capability in central government to oversee every single event in a large space. Every 3 years, each province elects a local advisor, not necessarily by popular vote although it is sometimes a component, to be the main advisor of the region to the Monarchy.

These advisors provide counsel about regional goings on and enable the King/Queen and their advisors to make decisions with the wants and needs of each region in mind. They become quasi-regional leaders often with high levels of wealth, power and influence in their own region. There is no real central army, but there are mercenary forces and small standing militias in some cities and towns. These forces are intended to handle crime, sickness and any problems of security like bandits. These security forces are not formalised, but often somewhat ad-hoc, being raised by the heads of security in each region as necessary.

The general population does not take a huge amount of interest in politics, and in return, the crown and their advisors are generally content for people to run their own affairs, only stepping in when required to solve disputes.

Around 30% of the population are humans, a larger proportion than any other race, but all sorts of others have settled in Aethalia and it has been a very prosperous example of integration and collaboration of all sorts of folk.
