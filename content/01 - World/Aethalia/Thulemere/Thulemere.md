## Description
Thulemere is the more industrial side of [[Aethalia]]. Blacksmiths, carpenters and builders generally have a stronger presence here as roads from [[Karak]] passes down here, near and through the [[Calenwyr]] forest, bringing both good quality Dwarvern steel and stone, as well as Elven oak. Thulemere also has to deal with its fair share of bandit raids on these trade routes, making them relatively dangerous to adventure in, but these raids have never been significant enough to severely disrupt commerce.

The regional advisor for Thulemere is [[Selvanna Everglade]].
