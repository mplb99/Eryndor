## Description
Podol is a quaint and affable village in the far eastern part of [[Thulemere]]. The people are mostly devoted to the rhythms of nature and farming, and are broadly followers of [[Chauntea]], the goddess of Agriculture. With its rustic charm, the village thrives on the simplicity of agrarian life. cultivating a deep sense of community that mirrors the fertile fields surrounding it.

However, once a year, the [[The Solthren Spectacle|Solthren Spectacle]], a festival that started around 75 years ago, transforms the town and its people. Merchants and performers converge, weaving a vibrant celebration that momentarily more than doubles the town's population. It's a day where you can almost feel the heartbeat of the town quicken as a mesh of people flood in. Drinks are bought, food is made and performers entertain the masses.
