## Brief Overview 
Woodguard is a small predominantly halfling village in the province of [[Thulemere]]. The [[Duramir Brook]] runs alongside the hamlet and the road to the pitchfork woods along the other side. 
## Description

Nestled snugly at the edge of the woods, this quaint hamlet exudes traditional halfling hospitality, standing as a testament to the peaceful co-existence of nature and community. The village primarily consists of small houses, with thatched roofs and the aromas of hearty stews, even in late summer, are prevalent.

The [[Duramir Brook]] gurgles merrily as it passes through the village, swelling up for halfling children to dip their feet in and occasionally swim in the small run off ponds it creates. Around you see some half-elves, content with this pleasant inbetween of forest and city life. A few are carrying carcasses of deer or some rabbit in their hands, with halfling children following them, excited for the feast at hand. 

The most well trodden path comes out of [[The Warring Monastery]] inn, a large sturdy establishments with two bright lamps on the outside.
