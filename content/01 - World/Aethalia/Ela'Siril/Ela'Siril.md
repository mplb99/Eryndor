## Description
Ela'Siril is a region primarily focussed on fishing and farming. The mountains of [[Valenseau Mountains|Valenseau]] provide sheltered climatic conditions where livestock can be well kept. The fishing here is the best as well and they are the only region to have had even occasional trade with the [[The Yongelap Islands|Yongelap Islands]], although nobody has ventured out there regularly for decades. The regional advisor of Ela'Siril is a dragonborn woman named [[Akra Kimbatuul]].
