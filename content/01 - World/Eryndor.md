## Description

The world of Eryndor has housed all manner of races since before people can remember. They say that Dwarves were birthed from the mountains, elves from the trees, halflings from the ground etc. Throughout the First Age, much was peaceful with the occasional skirmishes and small wars that characterise the general risings and fallings of powerful individuals.

The arrival of Humans from [[The Green Isles]] signalled the start of the Second Age, which we are now 3434 years into. This changed a lot in intra-regional dynamics. Trade quickly expanded, humans learned more and more about magic and soon became as powerful as the great Elven wizards. Affairs were less stable overall, but there were no great wars to speak of. What drove the humans from [[The Green Isles]] is now forgotten, and people are emboldened, sailing further and further out west for fishing and exploration. Little was found until an Island in the North was discovered, which has been called [[Arvendor]]. This island has now been settled for the last 200 or so years, not by one concrete mission, but rather by a series of individuals making their own journeys for their own reasons.

All manner of other races lived around the west coast of Eryndor before humans founded the kingdom of [[Aethalia]]. There used to be less of a city building culture, rather people formed multi-cultural tribes, centred around common goals and ideals rather than racial commonalities. Hunting groups, farms and spellcasting all made for ripe opportunities for members of different races to get to know one another. There are of course, some who isolated themselves a little more than others, but thus far they have restrained from outward hostility. the dwarves kingdom of [[Durakarn]] and the elven tribes in the Forest of [[Calenwyr]] are good examples of this.
