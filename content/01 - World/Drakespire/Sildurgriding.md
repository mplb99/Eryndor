## Brief Overview 

Sildurgriding was a village in the foothills of the [[Drakespire]], mountains. It was a peaceful village until it was beset by the evil red dragon, [[Feurbane]]. She raised the village in 7 days, forcing the villagers to flee. The villagers tried to seek refuge in the dwarven kingdom of [[Durakarn]] but were refused, out of fear [[Feurbane]] would attack the dwarves next. 

Some elven towns in [[Silmarien]] would allow people to stay, but the majority had to journey back to [[Aethalia]] with th former neighbours splitting up to find the best place to stay.
