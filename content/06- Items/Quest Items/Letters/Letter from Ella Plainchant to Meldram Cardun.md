 My Meldram 

I thought I should write about how much I love you, but I thought you probably didn't deserve the ego boost after the stunt you pulled at the Fox and Hounds last night. Chuck was furious, (but it did really look like he'd pissed himself). I doubt we're ever drinking there again. Their loss I guess, I imagine with all the extra work you've been taking on that you'll become quite a lucrative patron.

Sometimes not seeing you for a few days is hard. But I love how hard you work for me. I know it's for me and that, when we have enough, you can take that year off you've been talking about. 

We can see the world, sample the finest Nilathan wines, climb the Watch of Arvelenor, and finally be the tallest people in the world, and we can visit Kholbadur, and find your brothers and sisters, I can't wait to meet them. You were so brave, moving away, I love how brave you've always been.

We will be brave together, and soon we will have a family to be brave for, I know it. I know it, and I can't wait. I've been a teacher for so long, I know you'll think they'll make me headmistress soon. "You're just a much better teacher than the rest of them Ella!". I can't say I don't agree with you, but when you say it, I feel warmer and I believe it just that little bit more.

I love you, so much.

[[Ella Plainchant]] 

P.S Hope the hangover isn't too bad.
