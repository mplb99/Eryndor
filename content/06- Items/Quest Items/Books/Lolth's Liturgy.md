## Full Title & Abstract
Lolth's Liturgy: Politics, Power and Religion in the 66th Layer of the Abyss.

This book is an old formerly lost work about the spider queen lolth, a lot of information about Lolth and other chaotic evil gods has been destroyed by the Church of [[The Virtuous Divines]]. Research on this subject is not banned but certainly frowned upon in Otrana, it is heavily regulated in Espax, but permitted. However, the regulations and social disapproval in both places make it so that scholars choose less controversial subjects.

The content  of [[Lolth's Liturgy]] is outlined below:
## Content
The PC's can find a stone tablet in Gabilzor, encrypted to protect the work from being destroyed. It talks about the Spider Queen Lolth and gives the following information.

#### Tablet One
There are many strange things deep in the Abyss, but I would consider the mysteries that abound the Demonwebs to be the strangest. Lolth is an enigmatic figure within all folklore, and her status of power varies from each incarnation to the next. Is she and has she always been a goddess? Was she formed from the chaos of the Abyss, or demoted here after a fall from godhood? Or was she once a mortal drow, one who craved power above all else? Lolth is certainly not telling.

One legend that I would consider the most confusing would be one that I have heard all too often, even from supposedly intelligent scholars. They tell me, that while Lolth’s current palace is a beautiful and chaotic construction of spidersilk, she once had a great palace constructed entirely from metal. A demonic automaton, they call it, in the shape of a giant spider.

#### Tablet Two
**POLITICS/RELIGION**

Lolth, although she likes to lord over her layer of the Abyss with a tyrannical rule, is relatively lenient to those who live within her domain and don't do anything to affect her web of plans - whether directly or indirectly. She doesn't do this alone however. The yochlol are always at her side, but she also has eight "trusted" individuals that help her with her struggle for power throughout the multiverse: the Proxies, or the Eyes, of Lolth. They each help Lolth in their own special way, and they were all chosen because of their talents, and their worship of Lolth. And they can easily be replaced by Lolth.

First off, we have the twins Cerithia and Eclavdra, who are constantly at each other's sides. Known as the Weavers, they are beautiful, before you get to the waist. High elven features, they are elegant, with shiny pale skin that would put any model to shame, and it is said that their naked forms are more beautiful than any mortal’s. Eclavdra is blind, with milky white eyes constantly staring forward, and silver hair flowing down her back, while Cerithia has piercing violet eyes, and long pale blue hair braided down the demigoddess's back. Below the waist however, their form shifts into that of enormous silver and white spiders, with eight hideous legs constantly at the ready, making sure the twins are always able to move if need be. Besides this, they have four arms each. Two enormous ones that extend down to the ground, twisted in a way that only a demon's would be, weaving web constantly. Two smaller, more humanoid ones, are always clasped over the breast, seemingly holding something. Legend says that the two were lovers in life, and that they hold each other’s hearts in these hands, so that for one to die the other must first die as well.

Khandera, the Devourer, is a piece of work, and that's putting it lightly. Resembling a giant black scorpion with a human face and human arms and hands instead of claws, Khandera is one of the more feared Proxies, stalking the Demonwebs and only very occasionally venturing put into the Underdark to terrorise the locals and instil fear within the drow that worship Lolth. When she's not doing this, she devours everything within Lolth's demonic domain.

Next, Mirianth, the Deciever. Originally a lowly yochlol handmaiden, this demon has since been raised to her current position in Lolth's court. Although her true form is that of an enormous disgusting blob of wax, she will usually take the form of a drow woman shrouded in grey mist, yellow eyes glowing with hidden ferocity. She is always accompanied by a swarm of tiny black spiders, doing her bidding and working overtime to perform the duties that she tells them to. She has been entrusted by Lolth to spread lies throughout the multiverse that benefit the Demon Queen, and the spiders are used to whisper these deceits into the dreams of her victims.

Belos the Sickening. Sitting deep within a place in the Demonweb known to outsiders as the Oozelands, this overgrown drider-like she-beast is an awful sight to behold. Bulbous, oozing pus and bile, and bloated to twice the size of a normal drider, Belos is just as her name would suggest - quite sickening. She constantly exudes a foul stench that would make any fomorian cry for its mother. It is honestly the most awful thing I have ever smelt, and I had members of my crew die because of it. 

Dwelling deep within the Demon Queen's castle, torturing all those who stand against Lolth, is Tantalia, the Tormenter. Webs hold those who have angered Lolth above a great pit of unbelievable horrors - and the Tormenter. Her true form is unknown, and rumour has it that she is older than the Demon Queen herself, and most other demons in the Abyss. All that is known is that those who are sent to the Tormenter come back different. And the difference is always to the benefit of the Demon Queen.

Lilith the Seductress is one of the most beautiful beings in the multiverse. Her body, voice, and perfume can lead any mortal astray, immediately enthralling them with her beauty. This is of course used to Lilith’s advantage across the planes, Lolth sending her wherever a beautiful woman would best suit her plans.

The last Eye is Verxa. Always at Lolth's side, this enormous spider is constantly whispering in Lolth's ear, telling her the secrets of the entire multiverse and beyond. Even though she never leaves the palace unless told to accompany the Demon Queen, she seems to know all, and if you are an adventurer looking to learn anything about the multiverse, Verxa the Whisperer is one of the best ways to find out about it.

Besides these political figures of Lolth's court, worship of her is common throughout the entire layer. Although a lack of worship is allowed, and thus atheistic views are also common, worship of other beings, whether they be gods or mortals, is completely banned within the Demonweb Pits. Be wary if you are a cleric or paladin and decide to delve the webs of Lolth.

#### Tablet Three 
**TRAVEL**

Travelling to and from Lolth's domain is relatively easy. If you're travelling from anywhere in the multiverse, an easy _plane shift_ will work it out, although you'll most likely end up in the waiting room within Lolth's palace, and uninvited guests are probably the Demon Queen's least favourite thing in all the multiverse, so I don't recommend it.

Your best bet is to travel deep within the Underdark and make your way past various drow cities and temples and find the Vault of the Drow. Make it through this dungeon, and you'll find an enormous brass door. If you can convince the enormous spider that guards this door to let you through, or you're persuasive in some other way, then you'll find yourself at a similar brass door on the other side. Sitting on a small rocky plateau held aloft by spider webs, the door seems much larger in the Abyss and the carvings are much more intricate. Once you’re there, head to Spiderfell, and try to blend in.

#### Tablet Four 
**Arachne**

The arachne are an unusual race or beings that resemble tall, feminine humanoids completely covered in white or grey spider silk, forming clothing that wraps like bandages around the body and eyes. The mouth looks normal when closed, however it can open to reveal multiple mandibles. The silk may float behind them in the breeze, giving an ethereal look, or hang ragged down the body, evoking classic zombie movies.

**Spider Bats**Creatures that reside in the Demonweb Pits for too long may begin to take on qualities of spiders. Such is the case for the Spider Bat. Tiny spiders with wings fly in swarms across the Demonwebs, and Lolth will often send them to harrass adventurers that are travelling her domain.
