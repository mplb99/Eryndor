## Overview

The Grey Cloths are a tribe of bandits located in the [[Pitchfork Woods]]. Their leader was [[Octar Krulek]] a human bandit before he was defeated by the [[Piss Pals]]. The gang was then briefly seized by [[Rathene Fel]], a young upstart bandit from [[Dug Boldor]] and her partner [[Bernard Clayton]]. They confronted the [[Piss Pals]] as the [[Piss Pals]] attempted to return back to [[Podol]]. 

In an act of intimidation, [[Rathene Fel|Rathene]] stabbed former leader [[Octar Krulek]] to death in front of all watching, before engaging the piss pals in combat, furious at her humiliation after she was captured by the halflings [[Julilus Grimshackle|Julius]] and [[Russel Grimshackle]].

The [[Piss Pals]] defeated [[Rathene Fel|Rathene]] and [[Bernard Clayton|Bernard]] who died at the scene of battle. This left the Grey Cloths scattered and leaderless.

## History

The Grey Cloths were formed by [[Octar Krulek]], a former scholar angry at his inability to pay fees at university in [[Heliokon]]. They operated for a few months with modest success until they were approached by the warlock [[Malgrim Malal]]. [[Malgrim Malal]] offered [[Octar Krulek|Krulek]] a deal, embruing him with modest magical powers and in return [[Octar Krulek|Krulek]] would raid anything [[Malgrim Malal|Malal]] requested.

This deal served the Grey Cloths well for a time, until they came under the attack of Lizardmen. They did not know that these Lizardmen were also under the control of [[Malgrim Malal]], who used them to ensure the bandits never became too strong to stand up to him.

The Grey Cloths final mission was given to them by [[Caintop Everthorn]] as he and [[Malgrim Malal]] demanded the bandits capture the famous bard [[Willow Redivy]]. Unfortunately, for the Grey Cloths, this led to them being pursued and eventually defeated by the [[Piss Pals]].
