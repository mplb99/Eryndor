## Overview


## Description

The Tel'Eryn Eldorion were a group of 8 wizards, who came together soon after the creation of the world. They were blessed by the gods to be so potent and powerful with magic wielding that they could create [[Weavespark|The Weavespark]], the source of magic for all others in Eryndor.

Faced with the prospect of their own mortality, the group decided that the best thing to do was to lock the power away and they created 8 gems that contained a fraction of the power of the Weavespark. They called these gems [[Shards of the Void|The Shards of the Void]]. Each of these gems was imbued with it's own raw magical power, but the magic was so raw and powerful that it would eternally corrupt and destroy anyone who attempted to use the power of the gem without it being guarded in some way. For the gems to work properly, they needed to be placed in sceptres of pure adamantine.

Once these gems were created, each wizard took one of the gems and hid it somewhere within the world, they avoided telling any of the other wizards where they hid their gem. The wizards then, wandered in solitude, never meeting the others.

Each wizard, as they were about to die, ascended to the celestial plane and took most of their knowledge with them. Some scholars have uncovered small fragments of this mystery, but knowledge of it in [[Aethalia]] is very limited. It would take a formidably powerful adventuring party to uncover all of these gems and reunite them. But in the case of Eryndor being under grave threat, these gems could be used to unlock the most powerful source of magic in the land.
