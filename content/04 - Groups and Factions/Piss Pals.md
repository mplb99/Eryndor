## Overview

The Piss Pals is a group made up of [[Barbie Aryan]], [[Cassie Eridanus]], [[Cassius Illor]], [[Kiddi Fiddlerson]] and [[Serranna Fable]]. They were formed after rescuing the famous bard [[Willow Redivy]] and returning her to safety after she was kidnapped by the warlock [[Malgrim Malal]]. They currently are freelancers, mainly working for [[Selvanna Everglade]], but she only takes a passing interest, allowing them to piss on whoever they want at the moment.
